The commands (n, b, c, s, l, w, u, q, quit) are commonly associated with the Python Debugger (PDB), which is a built-in interactive debugger for Python. 


1) n (next):

Execute the current line of code and stop at the next line in the current function.


2) b (break):

Set a breakpoint at the current line or a specified line number. Execution will pause when the breakpoint is reached.


3) c (continue):

Continue execution until the next breakpoint is encountered or the program finishes.


4) s (step into):

Execute the current line of code. If the line contains a function call, enter the function and stop at the first line.


5) l (list):

Show the source code around the current line. By default, it shows 11 lines centered around the current line.


6) l with start and end line:

You can specify the start and end line numbers to display a specific range of source code lines.

7) u (up):

8) q (quit):

Quit the debugger and terminate the program.


9) quit:
